# Code of Conduct

We are committed to fostering an inclusive, respectful, and professional  
environment for everyone. All participants are expected to:

- **Respect others** – Treat all community members with courtesy and  
  consideration.  
- **Be helpful** – Provide constructive feedback and avoid personal attacks.  
- **Embrace learning** – Engage in discussions with an open mind and a  
  willingness to improve. Precision and expertise are valuable, but nitpicking  
  is not. Remember: *you didn’t know before you knew.*  
- **Report issues** – If you experience or witness any behavior that violates  
  this Code, please report it to the project maintainers.  
- **No harassment** – Harassment, hate speech, or any behavior that undermines  
  the well-being of others will not be tolerated.  

Violations of this Code of Conduct may lead to appropriate actions by the
project maintainers, which can include temporary or permanent restrictions on
participation. We appreciate your help in keeping our community welcoming and
safe.  

*This Code of Conduct is subject to updates. Please check back periodically for  
any changes.*
